# GitHub Stat Checker

GitHub Contribution Tracker is a **Streamlit** web application that visualizes GitHub user contributions with insightful metrics, charts, and achievements. This app uses the **GitHub GraphQL API** to fetch and display data about a user's contribution history, enabling users to track and analyze their growth.

## Features

- **Summary Stats**:

  - Total contributions across all repositories.
  - Highest contributions in a single day.
  - Current streak of consecutive contribution days.
  - Longest streak of consecutive contribution days.

- **Visualizations**:

  - **Contributions Over Time**: A line chart showing daily contributions.
  - **Yearly Growth**: A bar chart summarizing contributions year by year.
  - **Weekly Contribution Heatmap**: An interactive table visualizing contributions by the day of the week and week of the year.
  - **Day-of-Week Analysis**: Contributions grouped by the day of the week.
  - **Weekday vs. Weekend Contributions**: A bar chart comparing contributions made on weekdays versus weekends.

- **Custom Metrics**:

  - Most productive day: Displays the date with the highest contributions.
  - Contribution streaks: Real-time updates of current and longest streaks.

- **Achievements**:

  - Dynamic achievements unlocked based on contribution activity, such as:
    - **"ðŸ”¥ Streak Warrior"**: A streak of over 30 days.
    - **"ðŸ’ª Commit Master"**: Total contributions exceeding 1000.

- **Language Usage (upcoming)**:
  - Extendable with GitHub API to display language usage stats for repositories.
